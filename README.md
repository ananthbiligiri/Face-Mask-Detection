# Face-Mask-Detection
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether individuals are wearing a mask in images. The model is trained on a dataset with labeled images of people with and without masks. Using OpenCV and Keras, the app provides real-time predictions and displays the results with bounding boxes around detected faces. The CNN model is optimized for accuracy in detecting facial masks, offering a practical solution for public health and safety monitoring.
